 **Motivation:**
 
The primary goal of the GreenGuard project is to create an automated system that optimizes the conditions within a greenhouse. It does this by ensuring that the actuator (pump or other device) only activates when necessary. Specifically, the actuator will turn on when either the soil moisture or humidity levels drop below a specified threshold, and the temperature is high. This ensures that the greenhouse environment remains conducive for plant growth while conserving resources.

**Project Name:** GreenGuard - Smart Greenhouse Control System
 **Description:**
GreenGuard is a comprehensive smart greenhouse control system that helps you monitor and manage your greenhouse environment effectively. It utilizes a network of sensors to keep an eye on crucial factors such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature. The system's intelligent logic triggers an actuator (pump or motor) to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.

 **Features:**
- Real-time sensor data monitoring.
- Automated control based on preset conditions.
- Energy-efficient design.
- Scalable for different greenhouse sizes.
- Easy-to-customize with additional sensors and actuators.

 **Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Configure your hardware setup.
3. Upload the provided C++ code to your microcontroller.
4. Monitor and control your greenhouse using the system.
